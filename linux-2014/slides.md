## What is Python?
"Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability."

"Python 1.0 - January 1994"



## Whitespace
Yeah baby!

```python
class Hello(object):

    def world(self):
       print 'hello world'

hello = Hello()
hello.world()
```



## REPL
```python
 ~ $ python3
Python 3.3.0 (default, Apr 17 2013, 20:05:19)

## Speed
pypy

"PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language"

http://pypy.org/



## Upgrading
Still an issue

Majority of users are on Python 2x

eg. RHEL on 2.6

Which should I choose? Start with Python 3, but if libraries are a problem, go down to Python 2.

There are libraries for **almost anything**

The code will be pretty readable
